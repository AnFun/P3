Draws: 11

While such test cases took a lengthy amount of time, 
they provided more confident results because there was
a greater consistency as to who was winning. It appears that
the higher the node count, the smarter the bot will play.

When the bots are evenly matched at the same amount of nodes,
the first player appears to have a slight advantage on their side.
This may suggest that the first move allows the player to
control the board more to their liking as opposed to the second
player, who essentially must abide by the first play.
